\section{Methodology}
\label{section:methods}
The methodology section describes the research design and methods used for data collection and analysis. It includes a brief explanation of the rationale behind the chosen methods, the study's sample, and any instruments or tools used. Ethical considerations and study limitations are also addressed succinctly.

\subsection{Sobel Operator}
The Sobel operator (Table \ref{tab:sobel}) is represented as two convolving masks along y direction and along x direction for differential operation along $y$ and $x$ direction respectively.
