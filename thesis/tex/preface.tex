This thesis investigates the expressive use of network manipulation techniques in diffusion models for use in the domain of live musical performance.
The study aims to understand how different manipulation techniques can be employed by an artist to generate and control sound in a live setting. 
Additionally, this study explores how manipulations could be represented in an explainable musical interface. 
A mixed methods approach was used to gather and analyse data from musicians, artist, and their audiences. 
The results reveal [key findings]. These findings suggest [implications], providing valuable insights into [broader context]. 
The study concludes by highlighting the significance of [conclusions] and proposing directions for future research in [related areas].
